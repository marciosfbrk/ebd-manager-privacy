The AI engineer effectively managed a series of bug fixes and feature additions for the EBD Manager application. Initially, it performed a thorough environment setup, including dependency installation and service restarts. It then systematically addressed a critical login issue by identifying missing user data and implementing a script-based solution. Following this, it resolved the quarterly magazines page malfunction by populating missing magazine data and debugging frontend navigation. The engineer then successfully exported the entire system's data and created comprehensive local installation scripts. Finally, it tackled a complex data import challenge for attendance, adapting the input format to the backend's data model and successfully importing data for ten different classes, verifying functionality on both API and frontend levels. The final task was to prepare a full backup and create a package for local Git repository setup, ensuring all implemented data and features are preserved.

<product_requirements>
The EBD Manager application is a comprehensive system designed to replace manual spreadsheet tracking of Sunday School attendance. Its core purpose is to manage classes, students, users, attendance records, and quarterly magazines. Key functionalities include user login, display of quarterly magazine content, and detailed attendance reporting with statistics (presence percentages, offerings, distributed materials).

The previous AI engineer brought the application from 0 to 1, delivering an MVP. The current trajectory details further enhancements and fixes:
1.  **Restore Login Functionality**: The system needed to allow user login, which was initially broken due to missing user data.
2.  **Enable Quarterly Magazine Page**: The Revistas Trimestrais page was not displaying content, requiring data population.
3.  **Local Deployment & Data Preservation**: The user requested the ability to run the full application locally on their PC, retaining all existing data (users, classes, students, attendance, magazines).
4.  **Attendance Data Import**: A critical feature was the ability to import detailed attendance records for various classes, including specific student presence, offerings, and distributed materials. This involved defining a JSON format and implementing an import mechanism.
5.  **System Backup**: Creation of a comprehensive backup of the entire database and application state.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on preparing a robust local installation package for the user. This involved:
1.  **Creating Local Installation Scripts**: A new set of batch files and documentation was generated, including , , , , , and . These scripts aim to automate the setup process on a local Windows PC, covering dependency installation, service startup/shutdown, and status checks.
2.  **Integrating Backup Restoration**: The  script was updated to ensure it functions correctly and can potentially be integrated into the automated local installation process, guaranteeing that the exported data is automatically loaded.
3.  **Data Preservation for Git**: The user's most recent explicit request (Chat Message 309) was to create a package that could be saved to a Git repository, ensuring *nothing* is lost, including all created users, attendance records, and system data. The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating Vou criar um pacote COMPLETO para você salvar no Git com **TUDO** preservado - todos os dados, chamadas, usuários, sistema funcionando 100%. Não vai perder absolutamente nada!. This implies the current work is to consolidate all the system's state and generated scripts into a cohesive, easily downloadable and Git-compatible format.
