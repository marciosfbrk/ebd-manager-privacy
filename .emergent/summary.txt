The previous AI engineer successfully developed the EBD Manager application iteratively, starting from a base React/FastAPI/MongoDB template. The process involved implementing core CRUD functionalities for students and classes, a detailed attendance system with Sunday validation, and comprehensive reporting. Challenges included persistent data serialization issues, floating-point precision problems in calculations, and accurately implementing complex business logic like the Classe Vencedora calculations based on Excel formulas. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by incorporating user feedback immediately, refining UI/UX, and finally adding robust authentication and user management with role-based access. The project concluded with addressing deployment assistance and personalizing the app.

<product_requirements>
The EBD Manager system aims to digitize church administration, replacing spreadsheets. It supports two user roles: Secretaria (Admin) for comprehensive management (student CRUD, class config, reports) and Professor for attendance (presence, visitors, post-call), offerings, and material distribution (Bible/magazine). Key features include login/logout, soft-delete for students/classes, student transfers, Sunday-only attendance with possible other days, detailed consolidated reports (Matriculados, Presentes, Ausentes, Visitantes, Pós-Chamada, Ofertas, Bíblias, Revistas), an Admin Dashboard, and export functionality (Excel/PDF). Data validation includes Sunday checks, active classes for transfers, and non-negative values for offerings/materials. The latest additions required by the user include Classe Vencedora blocks in reports based on specific Excel-like formulas per department (Infantil, Jovens e Adolescentes, Adulto), a simplified attendance UI with single total fields per class (Offer, Bibles, Magazines, Visitors, Post-Call) and simple checkboxes for student presence, a modern app design with custom logo and pastor information, and robust role-based access control (Admin sees all, Professor sees assigned classes).

-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (NoSQL), UUIDs (for all IDs), JWT (for authentication tokens).
-   **Frontend**: React (JavaScript), Tailwind CSS (for styling),  (for session management), Context API (for authentication).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a typical full-stack architecture:



-   ****: This is the core FastAPI application. It defines all API endpoints () for CRUD operations on Students, Classes, Attendance, Offers, Material Delivery, Reports, User Management, and data initialization. It handles database interactions with MongoDB (using  env var), data validation, business logic (e.g., calculating attendance, Classe Vencedora logic), JWT authentication, and password hashing.
-   ****: The main React component acts as the central hub. It manages application state, routing between different views (HomeCover, Dashboard, Chamada, Alunos, Turmas, Relatorios, Usuarios), and authentication context. It contains numerous functional components for UI elements (e.g., Login modal, navigation, input fields, tables) and performs API calls to the backend using . Significant changes involved restructuring components for better maintainability, implementing real-time updates for attendance, refining input fields, and integrating the new UI design.
-   ****: This file contains global and component-specific styles, heavily utilizing Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the modern and responsive design. It was updated multiple times to match the user's aesthetic preferences and incorporate design elements like gradients, shadows, and colored badges.
-   ****: Contains  for frontend API calls.
-   ****: Contains  for backend database connection.
-   ****: Used by the AI engineer and testing agents to log testing outcomes and protocols.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement export functionality for reports (Excel/PDF).
-   Implement advanced reports (e.g., historical trends, configurable periods beyond a single date).
-   Add functionality for configuring academic quarters with specific Sunday dates.
-   Develop graphical representations and statistics for reports.
-   Implement automatic data backup solutions.
-   Assist user with direct logo image integration (base64 conversion and embedding) if the current placeholder is insufficient.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a comprehensive authentication and authorization system.
The application now features:
1.  **Login System**: An elegant modal for user login using email and password. Sessions are managed via  with JWT tokens.
2.  **User Roles**: Two distinct roles are defined:  (Secretaria) and .
    *   **Admin**: Has full access to all functionalities, including managing students, classes, detailed reports, and creating/managing other users.
    *   **Professor**: Access is restricted to only the classes they are assigned to. They can perform attendance for their designated classes but cannot manage students, classes, or detailed reports beyond their scope.
3.  **Access Control**: Permissions are automatically verified, and users attempting to access unauthorized areas are redirected. Filters are applied to class lists based on the logged-in user's role and assigned classes.
4.  **User Management (Admin only)**: A dedicated Gerenciar Usuários component allows an administrator to:
    *   Create new users (both Admin and Professor roles).
    *   Assign specific classes to Professor users via checkboxes, enabling fine-grained access control.
    *   View a list of all registered users with their roles.
    *   Remove users (with protection preventing the primary admin from being removed).
5.  **Initial Admin User**: An administrator user ( / ) has been programmatically created to allow immediate access and testing of the new user management features.
6.  **UI Updates**: The header now displays the logged-in user's name and role, and action buttons/views dynamically adjust based on user permissions.

The last interaction from the user was about difficulty connecting to Git for deployment, to which the AI engineer offered several alternatives and assistance in preparing the application files for direct upload.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to assist the user in deploying the application using alternative methods like direct ZIP upload to Railway or GitHub web interface, as they are facing issues with local Git setup.
