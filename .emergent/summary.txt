The trajectory details the iterative development and debugging of the EBD Manager application. Initially, the AI engineer successfully implemented a dynamic church leadership information system, including backend models and API endpoints, and frontend UI for display and administration. This involved modifying  and  to handle President, Local Pastor, and Superintendent roles. However, a persistent login issue repeatedly surfaced, shifting from an incorrect frontend URL configuration to a CORS problem, and finally to an . Despite multiple fixes and troubleshooting attempts, the user became frustrated and requested a rollback to a previous backup. The AI engineer was in the process of performing this restore, which encountered an initial failure via the API and was transitioning to a script-based approach at the trajectory's end. The interaction highlights a comprehensive feature implementation followed by challenging environmental and network-related debugging.

<product_requirements>
The EBD Manager is a full-stack application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) for managing a church's Sunday School (EBD), including user (admin, professor, student) and class management, attendance, and reporting.
**Key Feature Enhancements:**
*   **Dynamic Church Leadership Information:** Display and manage three specific leadership roles (Presidente, Pastor Local, Superintendente EBD) on both the pre-login initial screen and the main application dashboard. An administrative screen is required for dynamic updates to these roles, reflecting changes across the application.
*   **Core Functionalities:** Data import (JSON, Excel), automatic user creation, backup/restore system, UI customization (logo), Moderador role with specific permissions, and robust attendance tracking with edit restrictions.
*   **Stability & Access:** A fully functional login system for all user roles is paramount.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with  prefix, Pydantic models.
-   **Environment Variables:**  for , .
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** User roles (admin, moderador, professor).
-   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration for frontend-backend communication.
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes environment, supervisor for service control.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py:**
    -   **Importance:** Contains core API routes, Pydantic models for data (e.g., , ), and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Expanded  Pydantic model to include  and  fields.
        -   Modified  to return default values for all three leadership roles.
        -   Updated  endpoint to accept and persist all three leadership fields in the  MongoDB collection.
        -   Crucially, the  was reordered to be added *before*  to correctly handle cross-origin requests, resolving a persistent login issue.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:**
    -   **Importance:** Main React component handling UI, state management, routing, and API calls.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Updated display logic in the application header and the  (pre-login) component to dynamically show all three church leadership roles (, , ).
        -   Modified the  function to correctly handle the new  and  fields.
        -   Updated the  component (an existing admin screen) to include input fields and state management for the new leadership roles, allowing administrators to edit and save these details.
        -   Temporary debug logs were added and subsequently removed during login troubleshooting.

-   **/app/frontend/.env:**
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables critical for frontend configuration, notably .
    -   **Changes:** The  was changed multiple times during debugging, from a hardcoded preview URL to , to ensure the frontend correctly communicates with the local backend service.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Successfully restore the application to a previous backup state as requested by the user, specifically to the state before the church information management system adjustments. The current API-based restore failed.
-   Address the underlying persistent login instability, as it recurred with different symptoms () even after multiple fixes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to resolve a recurring login issue that manifested as  in the browser, despite the backend appearing to function correctly via direct  commands and supervisor status indicating it was running. This issue arose after successfully implementing a dynamic church leadership information management system and fixing an earlier login bug related to an incorrect  and a subsequent CORS configuration error in .

The user, frustrated by the persistent login problems, explicitly requested to volta o backup anterior ants de ajustar o nome na tela inicial (revert to the previous backup before adjusting the name on the initial screen). The AI engineer attempted to fulfill this by listing available backups and then trying to restore  using a backend API endpoint. However, this API call failed with a Pydantic  validation error, indicating an issue with the data format or the endpoint's expectation. The AI engineer was about to switch to a Python script-based approach for the restore operation.

<optional_next_step>
Successfully restore the application to the  state using a Python script, addressing the  validation error.
